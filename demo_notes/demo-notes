# Demo Notes

## cAdvisor Information Leakage

The cAdvisor port is exposed by default in many k8s installations at 4194/TCP.  So in a browser assuming that we have access to the cluster over a network we can simply browse to the port to look around

https://192.168.41.111:4194 

and it'll show us information relating to the cluster.  Whilst none of it is an immediate slam dunk compromise, it does provide quite a bit of interesting info. that could be useful.

## Attacking the API Server

Externally you'd expect most clusters to require authentication externally, however if the well named "insecure port" is exposed on port 8080 it's relatively simple to get access

kubectl -s=http://192.168.111.10:8080 get po

##  Attacking the Kubelet

There are two ports which are commonly listening relating to the kubelet. 

10250/TCP - Read/Write access
10255/TCP - Read only access.

attacking the readonly port we can get more info. disclosure

/pods
/metrics
/stats/summary
/spec/

so http://knode1:10255/pods can provide us some interesting information.

Attacking the main kubelet port we can do a lot more, if it's exposed.
